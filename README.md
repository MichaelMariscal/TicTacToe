# TicTacToe

This is a game for two players! In order to win, one player must match three "X" or "0" in a row, either going vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

When there are no other options, the game will end in a draw and the user can reset the game and play again!

If a player does have three in a row, that player wins! From there, the user can restart the game as many times as they want!

Have fun!
